Given the system is ready to start a new game
when I initialize a new Omaha Hold'em game with 4 players, each starting with 5000 chips and a small blind of 50.
Then the game should start with 4 players each having 5000 chips and the small blind should be set at 50

Given a new game of Omaha Hold'em has been initialized with 4 players
when the cards are dealt at the start of the game
Then each player should receive 4 cards

Given that all betting rounds have been completed in Omaha Hold'em
when the showdown occurs,
Then the player with the best hand according to Omaha Hold'em rules wins the pot

Given that a player folds during a round of betting
when that leaves only one player left in the hand
Then the last player still in the hand wins the pot
